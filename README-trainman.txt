# Trainman

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Trainman is a wood stove automation project that is both open source as well as open build.  It is based on the Raspberry Pi and uses alot of components from Adafruit.com.  The hardware is designed to be as simple as possible, same goes with the python script that drives it.  Trainman is not a finished polished commerical product.  Rather the goal of this project is to have a simple base which can be modified to suit your wood stove automation needs.  Feel free to modify/tweek/hack if you can do it without creating a safety hazard.


PROJECT PHASES:

The trainman project is broken down into eight phases with each sucessive phase adding more features and complexity to the hardware and software.   This way builder/maker can run the phase needed, see how it works and then progress to the next phase as desired.  Currently development is at phase #7.  This project is a work in progress and there is no schedule on when it will be completed.


CURRENT PHASES:

Trainman #1: Read stove and pipe temperatures using thermocouple amplifiers and an analog digitizer

Trainman #2: Display stove, pipe and room temperatures on alphanumeric LED displays

Trainman #3: Read and display room temperture from a 1-wire server and temperature sensor

Trainman #4: User control of the running program using buttons 

Trainman #5: Automatic fan speed control based on stove temperature

Trainman #6: Fan profiles allow user control over automatic fan speed operation

Trainman #7: Automatic air control based on stove and pipe temperature

Trainman #8: Air control set points allow user control over automatic air control


DISCLAIMERS:

This is a builder/maker project and not a polished commerical product.  It comes with no warranty and the consequences of using any part of this hardware or software rests totally on you.   Wood stoves are hot and you might get burned.  Your stove could melt down like a Fukushima nuclear reactor.  Life is hazardous.   Take calculated risks.   Make sure to clean your chimney on a regular basis and burn only well seasoned wood.   Understand the hardware and software before using it.  Test stuff out before trusting any peice of code.
