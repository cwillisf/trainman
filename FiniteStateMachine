  States:
  
  OFF - Air MIN, Motor Off
        Triggered also by Air MAX Min with Pipe Temp < Pipe Lowest.
  
  START - Air MAX Triggered.
          Motor Off
          Pipe Temp < PIPE LOWEST (200)
          Stove Temp < Stove Set Point
          
  WARM - Motor On
         Pipe Temp >= PIPE LOWEST (200) so it is in the Pipe Temp Governing Range
         Stove Temp < Stove Set Point
         
  BURN - Motor On
         Stove Temp is in the Stove Set Point Governing Range.
         At this point the Pipe Temp Should be < than the Pipe Temp Governing Range
         
         If Air position under stove governance is higher than Pipe Temp governance it probably means the
         main part of the burn is over and stove should be opened up to burn off coals. Going back to Pipe
         Temp regulation.
         
  COOL - Basically Pipe Temp Regulation
  
  COAL - Pipe Temp < Pip Lowest (200)
         Air gets set to MAX
